              My journey first starts with my family. They were very supportive with what i wanted to pursue in life and vice versa. My first pursuit in highschool and college was Mechatronic engineering.
              This chapter is important to me because it serves as my foundation. It's reassuring to know that even if i fall on hard times i have a family i can fall back on and straighten me out

              The next leg of my journey starts with me enlisting into the army. This was NEVER in my plans as a child/teenager but life forced me to adapt. This would be apart of my life for the next 6 years
              This chapter is important because it has enabled me to experience new things and it would be no stretch to say i wouldn't be where i am today if it wasn't for this chapter

             Where I am at currently. This part of my journey is marked by me getting into tech and my loving girlfriend.
             This present day part of my journey is important because while it is the present it is also my future.
