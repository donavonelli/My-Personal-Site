            <h5>Technology</h5>
            <p>Ever since highschool I have been interested in everything technology. I believe it will be more promonent in the future so i wanted to be ahead of it.  </p>

            <h5>Dogs</h5>
            <p>I love dogs. My spirit animal is a dog .I was born with paw prints on my hands (just kidding). Something about man's best friend makes them my best friends</p>

            <h5>Anime</h5>
            <p>As a youngin' I have watched anime. That practice has carried on for all my years after. It has now evolved into reading manga as well.</p>

            <h5>Playing Video games</h5>
            <p>While i have been steadily venturing away from this, video games remain true to my core and i don't hesitate to destroy my friends in their game of choice </p>

            <h5>Spending time with loved ones</h5>
            <p>I know it's a tad bit cliche but i truly do make a hobby of doing whatever seems interesting at the time with those i care about. Whether that's going for a walk in the park or going bowling, if they there im there.</p>

            <h5>Outdoors</h5>
            <p>The newest developed hobby in my life is anything outdoors. I have found a love for hiking and i have been on several trails recently . I plan to continue diving into this hobby for a good long while</p>
